CoffeeTracker
=============

Track coffee consumption and rank it against productivity. 

Users enter each coffee they drink, logging the time and the size of coffee. A notification is sent a few hours later, asking how productive you've been. This will generate simple plots that may reveal trends that could be used to optimize productivity.
